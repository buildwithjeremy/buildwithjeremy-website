        Most solopreneurs and small business owners spend more time fighting fires than building their business. I know because I've been there — and I've helped dozens of entrepreneurs break free from the chaos.

        I use the same systems-thinking approach I learned at Google and for small businesses — to untangle your operations and implement quick-win solutions that bring instant relief and a solid foundation for growth.

            We start with a 60-minute kickoff call to map out your daily tasks, tools, and pain points. Jeremy will identify bottlenecks and uncover what's causing you the most frustration or waste of time. By the end of this session, you'll have fresh clarity on where things are breaking down and which fixes will make the biggest impact first.

          <p class="mt-3 text-gray-600">
            Over the next two weeks, Jeremy works with you to implement at least one high-impact improvement. It could be setting up an automated workflow (so you stop doing repetitive tasks manually), reorganizing your to-do list into a manageable system, or creating a template that saves you hours each week. Together, you'll get something important done instead of adding to your to-do list.

          <p class="mt-3 text-gray-600">
            This package isn't a DIY course – it's hands-on. You'll have a second coaching call or work session to tackle the implementation, plus email support in between. Stuck on how to use a tool or worried you'll "fall off the wagon"? Jeremy's got your back with prompt answers and encouragement, keeping you accountable to actually make the changes.
